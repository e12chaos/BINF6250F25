In this project, I was able to practice and remember some of the basics of Python, especially how to work with files, conditionals, and functions. I also gained experience incorporating Python into an R Markdown document, which was something I had never done before. Another important skill was carrying over ideas from past classes—both in terms of coding strategies and how to structure an analysis. I realized and relied heavily on clear comments in some of my past assignements: when I wasn’t sure how I had solved something before, I could look back at old assignments and my own notes to quickly remind myself of the reasoning and decisions I had made.

# Generative AI Appendix
Description of which generative AI was used and its version:

Claude Sonnet 4

The entire prompt that was used to generate the content. 

"Help me fix my code, the spacing and anything else that would keep it from running (insert entire def check_file_structure(filename) code chunk)

An explanation of how it was used (e.g., to generate ideas).

Code debugging and syntax correction: When I encountered Python syntax errors (like missing quotes, indentation issues, and import statement problems), Claude helped identify and fix these issues.

A justification for why generative AI was used.

Because I was angry I couldnt get my chunk to run and knew it was something like  missing quotations so I used claude to help me fix it.
